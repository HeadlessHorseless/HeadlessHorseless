#### i do occasional C++ coding projects (most commonly anything source engine related). i am still learning how things fully work and whats the best way of doing well anything really, i mainly do whatever i know just works. (which is why i don't release any of the source code to my stuff since yk horrible code that i don't want anyone to see)

#### i currently work on a sourcemod cheat called Neuoanitic which is a rewrite of Oanitic (the original sucks please don't use it and just wait for the rewrite)

#### i once did gmod addons but i stopped because i don't like lua
