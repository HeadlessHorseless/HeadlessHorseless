#### i do occasional C++ coding projects (most commonly anything source engine related).
i am still learning how things fully work and whats the best way of doing well anything really, i mainly do whatever i know just works.\
i dont typically release any of my code because im rather insecure about it and dont really want much judgement on any of it due to said insecurity.

#### i currently work on a sourcemod cheat called Neuoanitic

#### i occasionally do gmod addons in lua whenever i feel like it (or just have a really stupid idea that i really want to see in gmod) (although largely halted for now due to lack of ideas and motivation)

### and no i cant always be available, i do infact have a life

if ya want to know me more as a person take a look at my strawpage @ lod152.straw.page (you can even leave me a message or a drawing :D)
